        question: 'How will the combat system work?',

        question: 'Will this game be pay-to-win?',
        answer: 'No. While you will be able to pay for summons, the game is designed so that more summons are helpful but not required for success.

We may introduce cosmetic items in the future, but these will not provide any gameplay advantage.'
