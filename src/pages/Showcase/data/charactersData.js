Stripped of identity and forged through relentless training, she was starved of kindness and saturated with violence, honed into a perfect weapon. Her masters carved skill into her bones, obedience into her mind, and death into her hands. Each mission survived reinforced a single truth: she was replaceable, a shadow meant to fight till she broke. In the Circle's cold halls, affection was treason, and failure meant erasure.\n\nBut even a broken blade can turn. Captured after a mission and marked for execution by her masters, she bit through her own hand to escape. Slowly, each of her captors met a gruesome death. Some say she perished after her revenge. Others whispered she joined Echo of a Dream. But no one knows.`,
