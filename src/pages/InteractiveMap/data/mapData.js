        name: 'Ariest Expanse',
        coords: { top: '47%', left: '74%' },
        lore: `The Ariest Expanse is by far one of the most hospitable regions to call home. Known for its lush and exotic landscapes, it stands as a haven of diversity, home to countless races and creatures. Humans are a minority here, while the beastkin reign as the dominant inhabitants, each tribe marked by different traits and traditions. Ariest’s vibrant lands contain many ancient ruins, many of which are from an era long gone. It also houses residents that you will not find in any other region. Are they connected with why the land's so alive?`

    {
        id: 'deadlands',
        name: 'Deadlands',
        coords: { top: '26%', left: '52%' },
        lore: `The Deadlands can only be described as a living hell. Its cold, desolate atmosphere feels less like a realm of the living and more like a land abandoned by the gods themselves. The surviving inhabitants cling to life along the region’s outer edges, while deeper within dwell others, beings who cannot be called alive. It is a cruel irony that the land, its true denizens, and even time itself seem afflicted by the same lingering decay. The name Deadlands is, without question, well earned.`

    {
        id: 'lerdant_coast',
        name: 'Lerdant Coast',
        coords: { top: '45%', left: '28%' },
        lore: `The Lerdant Coast is a vast vault of secrets, its mysteries buried deep beneath the waves. Legends speak of a goddess resting in its darkest depths. The region’s inhabitants are as unusual as the coast itself, amphibious beings capable of surviving both on land and in the sea. It's a place of constant change as new settlers from Ark’Thal arrive in search of fortune, drawn by whispers of hidden treasures scattered along the ocean floor. Yet, not all that glitters is a blessing, for among those treasures lies a sickening rot buried and waiting to be unearthed.`

    {
        id: 'ark_thal',
        name: 'Ark\'Thal',
        coords: { top: '48%', left: '50%' },
        lore: `Ark’Thal stands as the heart of civilization, a place where philosophy, art, and music combine to shape the very soul of its people. Its cities hum with intellect and creativity, every street echoing with debate, melody, and inspiration. Beyond its cultural grandeur, Ark’Thal is also the wealthiest of all regions, the cradle of innovation and ambition. From its marble towers and golden halls rise many factions, each deeply tied to the world in more than one way.`

    {
        id: 'ember_realms',
        name: 'Ember Realms',
        coords: { top: '80%', left: '55%' },
        lore: `And then there is the Ember Realms, a realm that could only be described as hell itself. In one corner lies an empire ravenous for expansion, in another, a dying kingdom desperate to reclaim its lost glory. Scattered across the third are clans bound by divine beings, wielding powers capable of extinguishing all that we hold dear. Beyond them stretch the wastelands, home to abominations that can devour one’s very existence. The land shows no mercy, yet it's a testament to the unyielding spirit of humanity, a place where even in ruin, humanity still flourishes.`
